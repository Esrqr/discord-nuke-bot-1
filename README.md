## Discord Nuke Bot
Welcome to the Discord Nuke Bot project! This bot was created specifically for the Community Nuker Server, a fun and lighthearted Discord server where users can nuke their own servers for entertainment purposes. Everything in this project is made with love, so if you enjoy using it, we would appreciate a star on GitHub!

This bot allows users to "nuke" their Discord servers, which essentially means to delete all channels and roles, ban all users, and then restore the server to its previous state. Please note that this bot is for entertainment purposes only and should not be used to actually harm any Discord servers. Use at your own risk.

### Commands
The Discord Nuke Bot comes with a variety of commands that allow you to control and customize your nuking experience. Here is a list of all the available commands:

`ban`: This command bans every user from the server. This is typically used as a part of the nuke process, but can also be used on its own if you want to temporarily remove all users from the server.

`help`: The help command displays a list of all the available commands and a brief description of what each one does.

`leaderboard`: The leaderboard command displays a list of the top users on the server based on their nuke count. This can be a fun way to see who is the most active nuker on the server.

`login`: The login command saves your Discord bot token, which is required for the bot to function. You can obtain your bot token by creating a Discord bot and getting the token from the Discord Developer Portal.

`nuke`: The nuke command initiates the nuke process on the server. This will delete all channels and roles, ban all users, and then restore the server to its previous state.

`restore`: The restore command restores the server to its previous state after a nuke. This can be useful if you want to cancel a nuke before it is completed or if something goes wrong during the nuke process.

`stats`: The stats command displays some basic statistics about your nuking activity on the server, including your nuke count and the time of your last nuke.

`token_nuke`: The token_nuke command is similar to the regular nuke command, but it allows you to specify a Discord bot token to use for the nuke. This can be useful if you want to use multiple bot accounts to nuke a server.

`unban`: The unban command unbanishes all users from the server. This is typically used as a part of the restore process, but can also be used on its own if you want to allow all users to join the server again.

`type`: The type command allows you to turn the auto_nuke feature on or off. When auto_nuke is on, the bot will automatically nuke the server at a specified interval. This can be useful if you want to have a constantly nuking server for fun, but be warned that it can also be very disruptive.
