Welcome to the setup instructions for the Discord Nuke Bot! In this file, you will find a guide on how to properly configure and run the bot on your Discord server. It is important to carefully follow these instructions in order to ensure that the bot is set up correctly and able to function as intended.

Before you begin, you will need to create a new Discord bot using the Discord Developer Portal. Once you have your bot's token and client ID, you can proceed with the following steps:

1. Set the token and bot_id fields in the config.ini file to the appropriate values. These will allow the bot to connect to your Discord server and identify itself.

2. Set the channel_name, role_name, and webhook_name fields to the names you want the bot to use when creating spam channels, roles, and webhooks.

3. Set the nuke_message field to the content you want the bot to use for spam messages.

4. Set the server_id and tracker_channel_id fields to the ID of your Discord server and the ID of the tracker channel, respectively. These will allow the bot to monitor and track your nuking activity.

Set the owner_ids field to the ID or IDs of the bot owners. This will allow you to use owner-only commands and customize the bot's behavior.

Once you have completed these steps, you should be ready to start using the Discord Nuke Bot. If you have any questions or encounter any issues while following these instructions, please don't hesitate to reach out for support. We are here to help you get the most out of this project and ensure that you have a successful and enjoyable experience using the Discord Nuke Bot.
